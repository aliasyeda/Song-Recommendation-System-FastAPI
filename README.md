# Song-Recommendation-System-FastAPI
# 🎵 Song Recommendation System using FastAPI

This project implements a content-based song recommendation system using song lyrics. The system analyzes lyrical similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity and provides recommendations through a REST API built with FastAPI.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Music recommendation systems help users discover songs similar to their interests. This project focuses on a content-based approach where recommendations are generated by comparing the lyrics of songs rather than user behavior or ratings.

The recommendation logic is exposed as an API so it can be easily integrated with other applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze song lyrics to extract meaningful textual features  
- Recommend similar songs based on content similarity  
- Implement TF-IDF and cosine similarity  
- Deploy the recommendation system using FastAPI  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is `spotify_millsongdata.csv`.

Dataset fields include:
- Artist name  
- Song title  
- Lyrics text  

The lyrics column is used as the primary feature for generating recommendations. Songs with missing lyrics are removed, and a subset of the dataset is used for faster processing.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

Dataset → Text Preprocessing → TF-IDF Vectorization  
→ Cosine Similarity → Recommendation Function  
→ FastAPI → JSON Response

---

## 🧠 Methodology

Text preprocessing is applied to clean the lyrics data. TF-IDF is used to convert text into numerical vectors. Cosine similarity measures the similarity between songs, and the most similar songs are returned as recommendations.

---

## 🌐 API Implementation

The project uses FastAPI to expose the recommendation logic as a REST API.

API Endpoint:
- `/recommend`

Input:
- Song name

Output:
- A list of recommended songs along with artist names

FastAPI also provides automatic API documentation using Swagger UI.

---

## 🧪 Sample API Output

Example response from the API:

{
  "input_song": "Imagine",
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "song": "Imagine",
      "artist": "Diana Ross"
    },
    {
      "song": "Dream On Little Dreamer",
      "artist": "Perry Como"
    }
  ]
}

## ✅ Results and Observations

The system successfully recommends songs based on lyrical similarity. Recommended songs may belong to different artists, which is expected behavior in content-based filtering.

---

## 👍 Advantages

- No user ratings required  
- Simple and efficient recommendation logic  
- Works well with text-based data  
- Easily extendable through APIs  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Does not consider user preferences  
- Requires lyrics for recommendation  
- Cannot recommend new songs without text data  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add user-based personalization  
- Include genre and audio features  
- Deploy the API to a cloud platform  
- Build a frontend interface  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- FastAPI  
- Uvicorn  

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete content-based song recommendation system using machine learning techniques and FastAPI. The system is scalable, efficient, and suitable for real-world applications.
